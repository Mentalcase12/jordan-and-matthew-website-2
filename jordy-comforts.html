                    <h4>Hey baby... just in case you need this</h4>
                    <p>I know sometimes things get tough, or maybe you're just feeling a bit down or weird. I wanted this little corner to remind you how <strong>incredibly special</strong> you are to me.</p>
                    <p>Remember that you're <strong>strong</strong>, you're <strong>amazing</strong>, and you light up my world just by being you. Even when things feel heavy, please know I'm always here thinking of you and sending you all my love across the miles.</p>
                    <p>You mean <strong>everything</strong> to me, Jordy. Always.</p>

                    <h4>If we argued...</h4>
                    <p>My baby, I hate it when we're not okay. It feels awful. Please know that even if I was upset, frustrated, or said something dumb (which I probably did if we fought üòÖ), my <strong>love for you never, ever changes</strong>. You are my priority, always.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes distance makes things harder, and misunderstandings happen way too easily. But what we have is so much stronger than any temporary disagreement. Can we please talk it through when you feel up to it? I just want us to be okay again. I miss you already.</p>
                    <p>I love you <strong>more than any silly argument</strong>. Please remember that. üôè</p>

                    <h4>If you're feeling sad...</h4>
                    <p>Jordy, if you're reading this because you're sad, my heart hurts right along with yours. I wish so badly I could teleport through this screen right now, wrap my arms around you super tight, and not let go until you feel even a tiny bit better.</p>
                    <p>Please don't feel like you have to put on a brave face or be strong all the time. It's <strong>perfectly okay</strong> to feel down, overwhelmed, or just... blah. You're never alone in it, okay? I'm here, thinking of you constantly, and I care so, so much about how you're feeling.</p>
                    <p>Let me know if talking would help, if you want a distraction, or if you just need some quiet company on call. <strong>Whatever you need.</strong> Just remember I love you endlessly, my baby. ‚ú®</p>

                    <p>I love your smile, I love your laugh (it's my favorite sound), I love hearing about your day (even the boring parts!), I love playing games with you (even when we lose!), I love falling asleep on call with you, I love planning our future... I just love <strong>YOU</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Never, ever forget how much you mean to me. You're my <strong>favorite person</strong> in the entire universe. Mwah! üòò</p>

                     <h4>When the distance feels extra hard...</h4>
                     <p>Hey my love. Sometimes this distance really, really sucks, doesn't it? If you're feeling it extra today, I just wanted to say <strong>I feel it too</strong>. Missing you like crazy is just proof of how much I love having you in my life and how much I wish you were right here.</p>
                     <p>But hey, every single day apart is one day closer to when we won't have to say goodbye on a screen. <strong>Hold onto that thought</strong> with me, okay? We'll get there. It's gonna be so worth it. And until then, know that I'm right here loving you across every single mile.</p>
                     <p>Counting down the days. <strong>Always.</strong> ‚è≥‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

                     <h4>If you're ever feeling unsure...</h4>
                     <p>Baby, sometimes brains can be mean and make us doubt ourselves. If you're ever feeling insecure or wondering if you're good enough, please hear me loud and clear: <strong>You are MORE than enough.</strong></p>
                     <p>You are funny, you are smart, you are beautiful inside and out, you are kind, and you make my life infinitely better. Don't ever let those silly doubts whisper lies to you. The way I see you? Absolutely perfect. <strong>Perfect for me.</strong></p>
                     <p>You're amazing, Jordy. Don't you forget it. ‚ú®</p>

                     <p>Hey baby, take a deep breath with me? In... and out... Okay, again... In... and out...</p>
                     <p>If things feel like too much right now, remember it's okay to pause. You don't have to handle everything all at once. Is there anything I can do to help, even from far away? Maybe just listen while you vent? Or try to distract you with dumb jokes?</p>
                     <p>You're capable of handling so much, but you don't have to do it alone. I'm here to be your teammate and your quiet space. Sending you a big, stress-melting virtual hug. ‚òÅÔ∏èü§ó</p>

                     <p>Sometimes, especially when I miss you, I just close my eyes and imagine what it'll be like when we finally close this distance.</p>
                     <p>Holding your hand for real, movie nights actually next to each other, cooking (and maybe burning) dinner together, waking up and seeing your face first thing... all the simple stuff.</p>
                     <p>It's going to be <strong>amazing</strong>, Jordy. Everything we're doing now, all the waiting... it's all leading up to that. I can't wait for our future. üåü</p>

                     <p>Thank you for your patience, for your laughter, for your endless support, and for just being the incredible person you are. You truly are a gift.</p>
